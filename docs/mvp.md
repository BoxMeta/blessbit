# BlessBit MVP Specification

## Goal
Build a minimal, non-custodial support and receipt system for Solana.

## In Scope (MVP)
- SOL payments
- Wallet-to-wallet transfers
- Off-chain receipts linked to transaction signatures
- Public receipt pages
- Basic creator/DAO dashboard

## Out of Scope (Not MVP)
- NFT receipts (PoG)
- Treasury enforcement
- Revenue sharing
- Fiat on-ramps
- Multi-chain support

## Core Principle
BlessBit never custody funds. It only adds context to verifiable on-chain transactions.
