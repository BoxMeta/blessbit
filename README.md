# BlessBit

**BlessBit** is a non-custodial support and transparency layer for DAOs and creators on Solana.  
It attaches human-readable receipts to real on-chain transactions, without holding funds.

Funds move wallet-to-wallet on Solana. BlessBit never takes custody.

## What is BlessBit?

BlessBit lets DAOs and creators receive support directly to their own Solana wallets while providing a clear, verifiable receipt that explains *why* a transaction occurred.

On-chain transactions show **that** value moved.  
BlessBit adds context so humans understand **what it was for**.

BlessBit is designed to be:
- non-custodial
- verifiable
- simple
- DAO-friendly

---

## How it works (high level)

1. A creator or DAO provides a Solana wallet address.
2. Supporters visit a BlessBit page and send SOL from their own wallet.
3. The transaction occurs directly on Solana.
4. BlessBit records optional off-chain context (message, label, visibility).
5. The receipt is anchored to the transaction signature.
6. Anyone can independently verify the payment on-chain.

BlessBit combines:
- **on-chain truth** (the transaction)
- **off-chain meaning** (the receipt context)

## What BlessBit does NOT do

BlessBit intentionally does **not**:

- Custody funds
- Act as a bank or payment processor
- Guarantee returns or outcomes
- Enforce profit sharing or distributions
- Replace governance, accounting, or legal structures
- Modify or rewrite on-chain transaction data

BlessBit is a **receipt and transparency layer**, not a financial intermediary.
